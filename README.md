This tool is designed for producers, developers, and AI enthusiasts who want to streamline their music production workflow, experiment with generative music, and build custom integrations with Ableton Live.

**You can transform this conversation:**
```
👤 "Create a brief minimalist/neo-classical composition in a style similar to Ólafur Arnalds'. (Ableton MCP) / I've loaded four MIDI tracks called "Noire" and "Noire (2) ["Emotional Felt" presets], "Noire (2) ["Reversed Felt" preset, for ambient background], and "Noire (3) ["Ethereal Felt" preset, also for ambient background]. All loaded with nice piano instruments. You have also a MIDI track called "Strings" with a nice string ensemble instrument loaded. Feel free to add new instruments and effects, if pertinent."
🤖 "Creating MIDI clips... Adding effects... Done!"
👤 "Then, use ElevenLabs MCP to create a spoken-word audio clip (default voice and settings) with a relevant poem in the style of “Jim Morrison” to accompany the composition."  
🤖 "Generating poem... Transforming it into speech... Importing it into your session... Done!"
```

pip install -e .
```

### 2. **Install Ableton Script**
1. Find your Ableton Remote Scripts folder:
   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\[You]\Documents\Ableton\User Library\Remote Scripts\`
   - **Mac**: `~/Library/Preferences/Ableton/Live [Version]/User Remote Scripts/`
2. Create folder: `AbletonMCP`
3. Copy `AbletonMCP_Remote_Script/__init__.py` into this folder

### 3. **Configure Ableton**
1. Open Ableton Live
2. Go to **Preferences** → **Link, Tempo & MIDI**
3. Set **Control Surface** to "AbletonMCP"
4. Set Input/Output to "None"

### 4. **Connect AI Assistant**

**For Claude Desktop:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AbletonMCP": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/ableton-mcp-extended/MCP_Server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Cursor:**
Add MCP server in Settings → MCP with the same path.

### 5. **Start Creating!** 
Open your AI assistant and try:
- *"Create a new MIDI track with a piano"*
- *"Add a simple drum beat"*
- *"What tracks do I currently have?"*

## 🎵 **AI Music Producer Extension** (NEW!)

We've supercharged the system with **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** to create an **AI Music Producer** that generates complete, professional tracks from simple requests!

### **🚀 What It Does**

Transform this simple request:
```
👤 "Create an Afro House track in the style of Black Coffee at 122 BPM"
```

Into a complete production plan:
- **Style Analysis**: Deep understanding of Afro House characteristics
- **Track Elements**: Kick, bass, hi-hats, percussion, vocal chops, pads
- **Harmonic Progression**: Am - F - C - G (style-appropriate)
- **Arrangement Plan**: Intro (32 bars) → Verse → Chorus → Breakdown → Outro
- **Plugin Recommendations**: Specific Ableton stock plugin settings
- **Mix Guidelines**: Professional mixing approach for the style

### **🎨 Style Intelligence**

The AI understands musical styles deeply:
- **Afro House**: Black Coffee, organic percussion, warm basslines
- **Keinemusik Style**: Sophisticated deep house, vintage electric pianos  
- **Progressive House**: Eric Prydz, epic builds, emotional breakdowns
- **Deep House**: Dixon, jazz influences, vintage warmth
- **Tech House**: Punchy, tribal elements, rolling basslines

### **🛠️ Stock Plugin Mastery**

Professional sounds using only Ableton's built-in tools:
- **Wavetable**: Advanced synthesis for leads, bass, and textures
- **Bass**: Dedicated analog-style bass sounds
- **Impulse**: Complete drum programming
- **Effect Chains**: Professional processing templates

### **Quick Start with AI Producer**

1. **Set your Google AI API key:**
```bash
export GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install google-generativeai>=0.8.0 librosa pretty_midi
```

3. **Try the demo:**
```bash
python demo_ai_music_producer.py
```

4. **Use in your AI assistant:**
```
👤 "Generate a complete Afro House track inspired by Black Coffee"
👤 "Create a Keinemusik-style deep house track with sophisticated chords"
👤 "Make a progressive house anthem with epic builds"
```

### **Available AI Tools**

- **`generate_complete_track`**: Complete track generation from description
- **`create_afro_house_track`**: Specific Afro House generation
- **`create_keinemusik_style_track`**: Sophisticated deep house
- **`create_progressive_house_anthem`**: Epic progressive house
- **`analyze_and_replicate_style`**: Analyze and recreate any style
- **`chat_with_ai_producer`**: Interactive music production guidance

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[You: Natural Language] --> B[AI Assistant]
    B --> C[MCP Server]
    C --> D[Ableton Remote Script]
    D --> E[Ableton Live API]
    E --> F[🎵 Your Music]
    
    G[ElevenLabs AI] --> H[Generated Audio]
    H --> C
```

1. You issue a command in plain English to your AI assistant (e.g., "Create a new MIDI track and name it 'Bass'").
2. The AI Assistant understands the intent and calls the appropriate tool from the MCP server.
3. The MCP Server (server.py) receives the tool call and constructs a specific JSON command.
4. The Ableton Remote Script (__init__.py), running inside Live, receives the JSON command via a socket connection.
5. The Remote Script executes the command using the official Ableton Live API, making the change in your session instantly.

## Advanced Features

<details>
<summary><strong>🚀 High-Performance Mode (UDP Server)</strong></summary>


For real-time parameter control with ultra-low latency:

```bash
# Install the hybrid server
cp -r Ableton-MCP_hybrid-server/AbletonMCP_UDP/ ~/Remote\ Scripts/AbletonMCP_UDP/

# Try the XY Mouse Controller example
cd experimental_tools/xy_mouse_controller
python mouse_parameter_controller_udp.py
```

This demonstrates how to build:
- Custom real-time controllers for Ableton
- Expressive performance tools
- Interactive music applications
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎤 ElevenLabs Voice Integration</strong></summary>


This repository can be integrated with other MCP servers, such as one for ElevenLabs, to generate and import audio directly into your project.

Set up the ElevenLabs MCP server according to its instructions.

Update your AI assistant's config to include both servers.

Example mcp-config.json:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AbletonMCP": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/ableton-mcp-extended/server.py"]
    },
    "ElevenLabs": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/elevenlabs_mcp/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
